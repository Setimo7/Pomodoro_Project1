# Pomodoro_Project1
To do this project I used basic programming logic techniques to make this Pomodoro clock. I had a bit of difficulty at first, as I'd never done a project of this type before, but fortunately it worked out very well, and I intend to improve it in the future and give it more functionality.

#Pomodoro_Project1_2.0

In these changes to the project, I've tried to make the code cleaner, as well as adding functionality for a break button.
I added some functions and removed others that were making the code too confusing.
